Big Files Related To Our Notes
================================


Because T33D exists as a Git repository, we have to be careful about including large files, especially large binary files, because systems like Git are not well suited for handling those.

The files in our example folder aren't actually big files, they are placeholder that we can pretend are big files when showing examples about how to deal with big files.

More information will be added here later about how this project will deal with large files.
