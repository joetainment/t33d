About this file and README.md
------------------------------

This file (`notes.md`) is the canonical folder note for this folder,
following the T33D convention where each folder's primary entry point
is a file named after the folder itself.

The `README.md` in this folder is intended to be an autogenerated mirror
of this file for GitHub compatibility -- but the autogeneration has not
been set up yet. For now, `README.md` is a manually maintained file.

Once the autogeneration script (`generate_readmes.py`) is applied to this
folder, `README.md` should not be edited directly. Edit this file instead.

See [[Style-Guide]] and [[Naming-Conventions]] for the full policy on
folder notes and README autogeneration.
