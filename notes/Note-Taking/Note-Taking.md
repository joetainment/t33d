Notetaking
==========


what's truly important about note taking is just that you:

- **actually do it**
- **use notes to supplement memory**    Make note of the things you're most likely to forget later!
- **keep them use yeahful ** dirty actuallykeep them available somewhere easily accessed and organized



Understanding 

When I was younger I completely underestimated.the value of having organized notes. I was also never taught how to take and organize notes in a useful way.
A lot of the difficulty of that was do to with the fact that way back then, I was mostly taking notes on paper.

I also had a lot of difficulty writing with a pen or pencil, and although typing was better, it was still difficult for me, largely because I had some serious health issues affecting my joints and muscles.

Fortunately, computerized voice recognition got pretty good, and nowadays I can mostly dictate my notes. Voice recognition as of 2026 still often requires a lot of manual editing after the fact (fixing punctuation, layout, etc) but nowadays AI and automated tools can really help with that as well.

I still take notes on paper, but nowadays I convert them to digital notes if they matter at all. I usually photograph the notes and then use software to auto convert my writing into computer text, or diagrams, or even vector art. Usually I can simply delete the photos of the notes later.

Your Notes Become a Sort of Second Brain
=========================================



Note taking as enabling and serving as a kind of second brain. 

There way to many specifics in the world for anyone tonremember.




especially when used with apps like Obsidian or Zettlr, andit has worked into a wiki style folder of markdown documents.

the second brain also becomes much more useful because whatever AI systems you have working for you, can interact with your notes and effectively become part of your second brain. (A lot of people are already using AI as a second brain, but it's way more powerful when paired with people's own notes. See NotebookLM to see something that really demonstrates how  powerful the combination can be.)

Also since you can include notes written by other people, you can end up with information in your second brain that you don't even know in your real brain. (Note that you should probably flag notes you didn't write or keep them in separate folders or something so that you can keep track of which ones you've written in which ones we're written by others. Especially since you might actually disagree or distrust the information in those notes written by other people, and someday in the future you don't want to be fooled into thinking they're your own notes, and end up assuming theybare true 



 them as such)
