Recommended Location
---------------------

Put your notes folder inside your user's Documents folder. This is the most portable
choice: many cloud sync tools (OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox) include Documents
automatically, so your notes sync and back up without any extra configuration.

```
Windows:   C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\Notes
Linux:     /home/YourUsername/Documents/Notes
Android:   /storage/emulated/0/Documents/Notes
```

Sync
-----

Whatever location you choose, set it up in a sync tool so your notes stay current
across devices. Options include:

- **Syncthing** -- peer-to-peer sync; the data never leaves your own machines
  (recommended for privacy)
- **OneDrive / Google Drive / Dropbox** -- easy setup, automatic if your notes
  are in Documents


---

Alternative Locations
----------------------

- Root of your synced cloud storage folder (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive)
- Root of a dedicated work drive, e.g. `R:\Notes` on Windows

Wherever you put it, make sure you have an automated method of repeatedly backing
it up and syncing it across devices.
