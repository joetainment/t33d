Apps for 3D Art
===============


Obviously we don't list all of them below, but these are the most common ones that anyone interested in 3D content authoring should be aware of. Some apps that have 3D features but are primarily 2D editors, such as Substance Painter, are found on the 2D apps page.

Widely used apps that are currently active and are still supported are listed first. Historical apps that aren't widely used anymore or are unsupported/discontinued are listed after.


Active Apps Used For Authoring 3D Content
=========================================


### FOSS

Blender
    .
    Now arguably the most popular 3D software (particularly if we include students and hobbiests) Blender contains a wealth of features and even contains additional functionality not usually included in 3D Authoring software, such as painting and illustraion (including 2D pixel and vector art/painting) Video Editing,Compositing for VFX, etc. As of 2026-02-28, blender is still less popular in the professional industry, but is rapidly gaining ground.
    


### Commercial / Proprietary

Maya - Generally the most professionally popular general purpose 3D authoring app. Maya is easy enough to use for artists who aren't particularly technical, but also is powerful enough to support workflows at major studios. Maya is widely used to creaet blockbuster films, pictures, triple-A games, etc.

ZBrush - The most widespread sculpting/modeling software.

Houdini - Excellent for highly complex procedural and technical workflows, less artist friendly.

Cinema 4D

Unreal Engine  (historically used only as a game engine, but now is more multipurpose)

Substance Modeler (procedural modeling, like Houdini can do)
