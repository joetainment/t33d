===========

T33D conventions for linking between notes, and the trade-offs between
wiki-style links and standard Markdown links.

Rules
=====


Use wiki links in source files [SOFT]
--------------------------------------

In T33D source files, use wiki-style double-bracket links:

```
[[Naming-Conventions]]
[[Style-Guide]]
[[Some-Subfolder/Some-File]]
```

These are the default link style used throughout the notes. They are
supported natively by Obsidian and Zettlr, which are the primary tools
for reading and editing T33D notes. They are simpler to write, and
Obsidian automatically updates them when files are renamed.


Standard Markdown links are not used in source files [SOFT]
------------------------------------------------------------

Standard Markdown relative links require a full path and file extension:

```
[Naming-Conventions](Naming-Conventions.md)
[Style-Guide](../Style-Guide.md)
```

These work in all Markdown renderers but are brittle -- renaming a file
breaks every link pointing to it, and paths must be kept in sync manually.
They are not used in T33D source files for this reason.


Autogenerated output uses standard Markdown links [FIRM]
---------------------------------------------------------

The T33D notes repo is intended to be publishable as a static site or
browsable on GitHub. Wiki links do not render as links in standard
Markdown renderers or on GitHub -- they appear as literal text.

To address this, an autogeneration step (not yet implemented) will
produce a version of the notes with all `[[wiki links]]` replaced by
proper relative Markdown links with `.md` extensions. That output is
what gets published or pushed to GitHub; the source files retain wiki
links.

This is a known open task. Until autogeneration is implemented, the
published/GitHub version of the notes will have non-functional wiki
links.

Background and Reasoning
=========================


Why not use standard Markdown links in source?
-----------------------------------------------

The main reason is maintenance. A notes repo is a living document --
files get renamed, moved, and reorganized. Wiki links in Obsidian
survive renames automatically (Obsidian updates them in place). Standard
Markdown links do not. The friction of keeping relative paths correct
across hundreds of files is high enough to make wiki links the practical
choice for the working copy.


Why not use wiki links in output?
----------------------------------

Wiki links are not part of the CommonMark specification. GitHub's
Markdown renderer, Pandoc, most static site generators, and most
Markdown preview tools render `[[Filename]]` as plain text, not as a
hyperlink. Any version of the notes intended for general audiences
needs standard Markdown links to be navigable.


The two-copy approach
---------------------

Source files use wiki links (easy to maintain).
Generated output uses standard Markdown links (works everywhere).

The generator replaces `[[Target]]` with `[Target](path/to/Target.md)`,
computing the correct relative path from the source file's location.
This is a well-understood transformation and can be done by a simple
script.

| Foam (VS Code)               | Yes                      |
| GitHub file viewer           | No -- plain text         |
| Pandoc                       | No -- plain text         |
| CommonMark renderers         | No -- plain text         |
| Static site generators       | Depends on plugin        |
