About The T33D Project Itself
=============================

This folder is for planning and documenting the standards, best practices, and development progress of the T33D project itself.

End users will generally not have reason to read anything in this folder.




T33D Style Guide
================


This is the top-level style guide for the T33D project. It defines the reasoning
and principles behind all formatting, naming, and organizational decisions.
Specific rule sets are broken out into their own documents and linked below.

See also:
- [[Naming-Conventions]] -- file and folder naming rules, separators, ordering
- [[Capitalization-in-Filenames-and-Headings]] -- title case rules, brand names, exceptions

Philosophy
----------

Style decisions in T33D prioritize:

1. **Readability first** -- names should read well when rendered as titles, not just
   when browsed in a terminal. A folder tree viewed in Obsidian or GitHub is a UI,
   and it should look like one.

2. **Consistency over purity** -- where style guides disagree, we pick one rule and
   apply it uniformly rather than following any single authority perfectly.

3. **Tool compatibility** -- decisions account for Obsidian, Zettlr, GitHub, and
   Windows filesystem constraints simultaneously. Where these conflict, we document
   the tradeoff explicitly rather than pretending it doesn't exist.

4. **Low maintenance** -- conventions should be easy to follow without looking them
   up constantly. Rules that require judgment calls on every filename are bad rules.

5. **Soft decisions are documented** -- not every decision is final. Where a rule
   is provisional or likely to evolve, it is marked as such so future changes are
   made consciously rather than by drift.

6. **T33D's Own Branding** -- Some decisions involve T33D's own branding, such as the
   rules for when to Capitalize the name of the project, T33D itself.

T33D's Own Branding
-------------------

T33D is usually written as all caps even though
in code, and in file and folder names used by codebases or other systems,
the project name is written lowercase, as t33d. 

Our main Python package name page is t33d lowercase,
and hopefully we will use lowercase t33d as the pypi package name as well,
if t33d is ever accepted into pypi.



Document Autogeneration
-----------------------

`README.md` files are **autogenerated** from folder notes and should not be edited
directly. Each folder's canonical entry point is `FolderName/FolderName.md`. The
`README.md` is a generated mirror for GitHub compatibility.

The reason for this split rather than using `README.md` as the primary file:
Obsidian and Zettlr treat a file named after its parent folder as a natural
folder note -- it becomes a linkable note (`[[FolderName]]`), appears cleanly
in the graph, and follows the dominant convention in those tools. `README.md`
is the dominant convention for GitHub and other repository browsers, which
automatically surface it as the folder's display page. These two conventions
are incompatible as a single file, so we maintain the Obsidian-native file as
the source of truth and generate the GitHub-facing file from it. This keeps
the vault clean and the GitHub view accurate without manual duplication.

See `generate_readmes.py` for the generation script.

Scope of These Documents
------------------------

These style documents cover:

- File and folder naming (separators, case, ordering, dates)
- Title case rules and brand name handling
- Folder note and README conventions
- Numeric and date-based ordering schemes

They do not cover:

- Internal markdown formatting (headings, links, frontmatter) -- TBD
- Git workflow and commit conventions -- TBD
- Code style within scripts -- TBD

Status and Versioning

This style guide is a living document. Sections marked **[SOFT]** represent
provisional decisions that may change. Sections marked **[FIRM]** are settled.

About this file and its folder's names being all lowercase, unlike other T33D note files.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The filename of this file itself actually breaks our usual naming convention rules because it follows the more prioritized naming convention rule of being named exactly the same as the folder it is in, plus the .md extension)

This is the sort of thing that is addressed and standardized via the documentation in this folder!
