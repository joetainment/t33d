Em Dashes -- Avoid Using Them!
================================

The actual character for Em dashes in T33D notes and documentation should be avoided.  When writing, inside documents an actual double dash `--` should be used as a standin (by convention people know that's what it means.) Many markdown capable viewers/converters/browsers/renderers will actually convert this to an Em Dash, and if so, that's okay. We simply shouldn't have em-dash characters in the source files.

This is done to avoid editors having to use obscure characters that are not easily typed on standard US keyboards (and which may be missing on many other keyboards as well).
