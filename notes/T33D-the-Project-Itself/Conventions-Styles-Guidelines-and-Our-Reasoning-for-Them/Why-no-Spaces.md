Why No Spaces
=============


Why the T33D project doesn't use spaces in file and folder names
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Because we are a public project, the T33D project avoids using spaces in file and folder names. This works better with various systems like Git and websites like GitHub, where our content is shown. This helps avoid various technical problems, and let's us keep things more consistent across platforms, especially when adapting names between systems. Using dashes instead of spaces for file and folder names on the web is a fairly well established convention. Especially useful for publishing, for naming files and folders that will be online, such as those shown in websites.

In code, for variable/function/class names, dashes normally aren't used, and in those cases where dashes aren't allowed, we simply use underscores instead of dashes.

See our styleguide and naming conventions documents for more detailed information.
