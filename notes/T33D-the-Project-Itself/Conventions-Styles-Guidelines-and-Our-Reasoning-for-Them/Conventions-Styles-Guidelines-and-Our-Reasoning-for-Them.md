About this file and its folder's names being all lowercase, unlike other T33D note files.
===========================

The filename of this file itself actually breaks our usual naming convention rules because it follows the more prioritized naming convention rule of being named exactly the same as the folder it is in, plus the .md extension)

This is the sort of thing that is addressed and standardized via the documentation in this folder!
