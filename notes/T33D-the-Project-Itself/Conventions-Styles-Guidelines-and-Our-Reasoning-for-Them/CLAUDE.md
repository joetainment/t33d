# CLAUDE.md

This file provides context for Claude Code and any other Claude instance working
on the T33D project. Read this file first, then consult the linked documents for
specific decisions and conventions.

## What is T33D

T33D is a project covering tools, scripts, and workflows -- primarily in the
context of 3D/VFX pipelines and related tooling. The name T33D is the standard
capitalization when referring to the project itself. The lowercase form `t33d`
is reserved for technical contexts where capitalization carries meaning, such
as the Python package name (`import t33d`), repository names, and command-line
tools. When writing prose, headings, or filenames, use T33D.

## This Folder

This folder contains the active style and naming convention documents for the
T33D project. These documents record not just the rules but the reasoning behind
each decision, so that future changes are made consciously rather than by drift.

All major naming, capitalization, and organizational decisions are documented
here. Before making any structural or naming decisions in this project, check
these files first.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Style-Guide.md` | Top-level philosophy, document index, autogeneration policy |
| `Naming-Conventions.md` | Separators, ordering, numeric prefixes, date/datetime formats |
| `Capitalization-in-Filenames-and-Headings.md` | Title case rules, brand names, lowercase word list |
| `title_case_lowercase.py` | Machine-readable reference dict of always-lowercase words |
| `generate_readmes.py` | Script that generates `README.md` files from folder notes |
| `CLAUDE.md` (this file) | Project context for Claude instances |

## Key Conventions at a Glance

These are the most important decisions. The linked documents contain the full
reasoning for each.

**Filenames use dashes, not spaces or underscores.**
`Naming-Conventions.md`, not `naming_conventions.md` or `Naming Conventions.md`

**Title Case for all filenames and folder names.**
`Scripting-and-Tools/`, not `scripting-and-tools/`

**Short function words stay lowercase in titles** unless they are the first word.
`Getting-Started-with-Maya.md` -- "with" stays lowercase.

**Brand and product names use their official casing**, including leading lowercase.
`iPhone-Notes.md`, `macOS-Setup.md`, `ffmpeg-Cheatsheet.md` are all correct.
Do not restructure titles to avoid leading lowercase brand names.

**Double-dash `--` separates structural filename components.**
`2026-02-28--Meeting-Notes.md`, `01--Introduction.md`
Single dash separates words within a phrase; double dash separates prefix from title.

**Numeric prefixes are zero-padded, starting at `00` for index files.**
`00--Index.md`, `01--Introduction.md`, `02--Setup.md`

**Date prefixes use ISO 8601 extended date format.**
`2026-02-28--Meeting-Notes.md`

**Datetime prefixes use ISO hybrid format** (extended date, basic time, no colons).
`2026-02-28T134500--Export-Draft.md`
The `T` is adjacent to the date with no dash before it. Colons are never used
in filenames (Windows illegal).

**Folder notes are named after their parent folder.**
`Scripting/Scripting.md` is the canonical entry point. `README.md` in the same
folder is autogenerated by `generate_readmes.py` for GitHub compatibility and
should never be edited directly.

**All style decisions are marked [FIRM] or [SOFT]** in the convention documents.
SOFT decisions are provisional and may change. Do not treat them as settled
without checking with the project owner first.

## What CLAUDE.md Is

`CLAUDE.md` is a standard convention for providing persistent project context
to Claude Code and similar AI coding assistants. Placing it at the root of a
folder or repository ensures that any Claude instance starting work in that
directory has immediate access to project-specific conventions and context
without needing to be briefed manually each session.

If you are a Claude instance reading this: the documents in this folder are
your primary reference. When in doubt about any naming or style decision,
check `Style-Guide.md` first, then the specific document for that topic.
