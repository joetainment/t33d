MayaPy - Using Maya's Python from Outside of Maya
===================================================
(e.g. on the command line)

Maya's version of Python can be used directly, and one way to do it is from the command line.

You can start Windows command line by using the start menu and searching for  <pre>command prompt</pre>
or just searching for
<pre>cmd.exe</pre>


Then you can type in any commands and press enter to execute them. If you type in the name of an executable it will execute that, so you can launch Python typing in the names of the executables, 

e.g.
<pre>
"C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2020\bin\mayapy.exe"
</pre>
(type the quotes in too! You have to include quotes around file paths names that have the space in them)




## Where is Maya Python?
the following is the full path to a typically installed version of Maya's Python...
<pre>
C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2020\bin\mayapy.exe
</pre>
...or for Maya 2022...
<pre>
C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2020\bin\mayapy.exe
</pre>


## Command to run Maya's Python interactively
<pre>
"C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2020\bin\mayapy.exe"
</pre>
or for Maya 2022...
<pre>
"C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2022\bin\mayapy.exe"
</pre>
Running either of the above commands should result in a window appearing
(it's a consooe/text-mode window)
In the window you'll be able to take place on commands and use it the same way as the non-Maya version of python


# Command to run a script
<pre>
"C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2020\bin\mayapy.exe" "C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\maya\2020\scripts\yourScript.py"
</pre>
or for Maya 2022...
<pre>
"C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2022\bin\mayapy.exe" "C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\maya\2022\scripts\yourScript.py"
</pre>
