t33d standalone utilities

This file will contain utilities which can be directly used by other standalone scripts by copy pasting text/code from this file into those scripts.
It's functions can also be directly used by end users if they import it, but then of course the scripts that use it won't really be standalone.

Generally code here is a copy of code in the t33d.utils submodule
