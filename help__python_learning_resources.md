Python Learning Games
===============================

Playing educational games is a fun and easy way to learn programming. Even if some of these might seem like they are "for kids", they can still be very useful for any beginners. These are generally games you play by writing Python code!

https://codecombat.com/
  - You can play it with no account. When it asks for account, look for the "no account" option if you don't want to make one.
  - This one is very easy to get started with. 

https://py.checkio.org/   Can also be played with no account.
  - Tricky to get started on.  Complicated beginning instructions, but the system works well once you get a basic candle on it.
  - To win first example change "return None"  to "return a * b"  then press the check solution button.

http://www.codewars.com/
  - Seems to require an account (Free registration should be enough).
  - This one has a lot of more advanced examples. It's more professional or academic as opposed to being for kids.

Books About Python in General
===================================

### Dive Into Python 3

(This is a really amazing but less easy book.<br>
It is especially useful for people already familiar with other programming languages.)<br>
